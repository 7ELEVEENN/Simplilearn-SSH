Hello World!

Create an essay about yourself.

Everytime I see all the rays of the sun are all streaming through the weaves in your hair
and evey star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight
the beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
and it's looking for a rhythm like you
you can take the darkness from the pit of the night
and turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
I gotta follow it
'Cause everything I know
Well it's nothing 'til I give it to you


I swear to Zues you're Aphrodite in disguise
No I, can't breath now, can't breathe at all
